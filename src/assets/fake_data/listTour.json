Tokyo is over 400 years old originally starting out as a castle town called Edo. It soon became the political and administrative capital of Japan and now is a fantastic mixture of futuristic skyscrapers, neon lights, fashionable shops, museums, shrines, temples and parks. Much of your experience of Japan will best be absorbed by wandering the streets, peering into shops, discovering ancient buildings and relaxing in Japan’s tranquil parks."
